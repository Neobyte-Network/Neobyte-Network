				<<p class="paragraph question">Information and rules regarding our ARK Survival Server are written below, we would be more than happy to answer any question on our <a href="ts3server://ts.neobyte-network.net">Teamspeak</a> Or on our <a href="https://discord.gg/nuzD5f4">Discord</a> </p>

				<p class="paragraph question">Genral Rules</p>


				<ul>
					<li>No impenetrable dino armor, simply put, if your dino can’t be hit my dinos, bullets, or turrets, it's against the rules.</li>


					<li>No rider protection. Players riding a creature must be able to be picked off their dino.</li>


					<li>No C4 suicide bombing. This includes attaching C4 to tamed creatures, wild dinos, players, or structures with the intent of using it to raid a base.</li>


					<li>No dropping wild dinos into Passive Pens. This will be strictly enforced.</li>


					<li>No building on the volcano or penguin islands.</li>


					<li>No using bugs or exploits. If it’s not intended to be in the game, do not use it unless otherwise stated in the rules. (Examples would be using glitched dino’s with insane stats from ORP or rendering yourself untargetable from turrets.)
</li>


					<li>No blocking off/limiting access to unique resources. This includes but is not limited to; cave entrances, underwater drops, cave drops, and supply drops.</li>

				</ul>

				<p class="paragraph question">Notes On PVP</p>


				<p class="”paragraph”">Here are some of the notes on our PVP'ing, please read them carefully!</p>


				<ul>
					<li>Due to the passive pen, bases can be completely wiped off the map if a tribe wishes it. </li>


					<li>This is a PVP server and complaining in chat will more than likely only get your further raided by someone who witnesses the complaining.</li>


					<li>Passive pens *can* be raided in a sense, see the passive pen rules below before attempting to raid a passive pen as there are strict punishments for wrongly raiding a passive pen.</li>


					<li>Often times, people will be accused of cheating, breaking the rules, etc. Please provide proof to an admin if at all possible. ORP is in place to help keep you safe while you are offline unable to provide proof of cheating. Please include players names in all ban reports.
</li>


					<li>Do not make false claims in chat.</li>


					<li>You may imprison people, however there is a limit of 30 minutes to this rule. We do not wish to ruin people’s experience by keeping them trapped forever. The exception to this is that if you are conducting a raid and manage to capture an opponent, you can keep them imprisoned as long as the raid lasts. (You cannot attack the base every hour for a week and claim you are raiding the whole time.)
</li>


					<li>English only in global chat. This is not meant to be discriminatory, it’s just that the vast majority of players speak and understand English and we do not wish for there to be any confusion. Tribe names and player names can be in any language.
</li>

				</ul>
				<p class="paragraph question">Passive Pens:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Passive pens are a specified location far enough away from your base to avoid damage.</li>


					<li>Passive pens are untouchable in terms of killing dinos, provided everything in your passive pen is on passive.</li>


					<li>Passive pens *can* be raided in a sense, see the passive pen rules below before attempting to raid a passive pen as there are strict punishments for wrongly raiding a passive pen.</li>


					<li>Passive pens are not intended to be used as loot storage. Players found using the passive pen as unraidable loot holds will be held to an appropriate punishment.
</li>


					<li>Passive pens must not have any sort of defenses at all, otherwise it is no longer a passive pen. </li>

					<li>Examples of acceptable structures are egg collectors, vanilla generators (they cannot lock and anyone can access them) or advanced feeding troughs. </li>


					<li>Passive pens must be accessible to all other players in the map. This means there must be a whole in the walls accessible by players, lack of ceiling, unlocked door, etc. (S+ doors lock on restart, not recommended to use.) </li>


					<li>Passive pens may not contain any sort of storage item that is not pin coded with the pin code posted inside the passive pen, or any storage structures that are not unlocked. (Again, S+ structures lock on restart, DO NOT use these.)
</li>

				</ul>
				<p class="paragraph question">Raiding a Passive Pen:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>It is important to note that ANY passive dinos killed will result in a severe punishment of the attacker. There is no need to use explosives or any sort of AOE damage items in or around the Passive Pens so there will not be any leniency for “accidents”. </li>


					<li>Passive Pens that include locked structures that can be broken by hand are allowed to be broken. If a structure is pin coded with the code posted, or unlocked, you may not break or damage the structure. </li>


					<li>Dinos inside the Passive Pen are able to be tranq’d and the items/saddles taken off of them. However, exercise caution as some lower level dinos may be killed by using tranq items. If you kill a dino by trying to knock it out, you will be punished. Be methodical in your methods of knocking out creatures so you do not get in trouble. Poison grenades are a non-damaging alternative if you must knock out a low level dino.</li>


					<li>Please note that any damage to the dino pen or passives inside is strictly prohibited. Proceed with extreme caution when raiding a pen. I cannot stress this enough.</li>

					<li>The Passive Pen is in place to ensure if a tribe is completely base wiped, they do not lose their passive tames they spent hours taming. They may need to regrind saddles, but ultimately the Passive Pen is around so people are never completely wiped and will stick around and rebuild. </li>

					<li>If a dino is on neutral inside the passive pen, the burden of proof is on the attacker to prove it. This is easy enough to prove, take a screenshot of it running towards you, or a video is even better. </li>


					<li>If you kill a dino inside the passive pen and cannot provide proof it was on neutral, you will be punished. </li>


				</ul>

				<p class="paragraph question">Important Information:</p>


				<p class="”paragraph”">If your base happens to be in sight of a supply drop spawn, please ensure that players have the ability to get that supply drop safely, without taking damage from your base’s defenses. (Turrets and Plant X)</p>

				<p class="paragraph question">Craftable Tribute Terminal:</p>

				<p class="”paragraph”">As this server has a very high gather rate, prolonged periods of gathering will cause lag spikes for everyone on the server. The reason behind this is as you gather, the dino you are using to gather with gains more and more amounts of data coming and going from it. The easiest way to alleviate this lag is to use the craftable tribute terminal to upload the dino, then download it. This “resets” the dino’s packets and tremendously reduces lag.</p>


				<ul>
					<li>It’s important to note all items (including saddles) will be dropped when you upload a dino. Plan accordingly.</li>


					<li>The craftable tribute terminal can also be used to move slow dinos around the map, and large quantities of items around the map as well. While this is acceptable and intended, there are a few things to remember. </li>


					<li>You CANNOT use a tribute terminal to move dinos or items to and from raids. This is unfair as you can easily drop 5 tank brontos on someone’s base instantly, etc.</li>


					<li>You CANNOT use a tribute terminal to store dinos/items in places that cannot be normally accessible such as glitched spaces, or inaccessible areas around the map that would result in your stuff being 100% safe.</li>

					<li>You CANNOT use the terminal for anything related to PVP. If you are not sure about whether or not it’s PVP related, ask an admin.</li>
				</ul>
